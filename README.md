## Arcade Game Clone, Udacity FEND project [4/8]

Live version: https://ewastasiak.github.io/arcade-game/

## How to Run and Play the Game

1. Use Chrome or Firefox. Opera should be fine(-ish). Internet Explorer – bad idea.
2. The game is ready to play as soon as the page loads. If you are using a downloaded version, unzip the file and run _index.html_.
3. You can start moving around by using arrow keys:
``move up: ↑
move down: ↓
move left: ←
move right: →``
4. **Plot foreshadowing**: you are a fragile ladybug on a green meadow. A very thirsty ladybug, at that.
5. Ergo: you need to reach the nearby river and have a rejuvenating drink. ASAP.
6. Unfortunately, a crystal clear body of water is not the only thing before your eyes. There's also a grim parade of ghostly Jims Morrisons.
7. Yeah, you've read that correctly. Multiple Jims Morrisons.
8. Your mission is quite clear by this point, right? Reach the tasty water. Don't get squashed in the process. You might try to repeat your success a few times. Ten times, for instance.
9. I really like number 9.

## License:
Soon(-ish).
